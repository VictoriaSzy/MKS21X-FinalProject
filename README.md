# Development Log
01-03-2019: Creation of the Repository                                                                                                      
Victoria: I created the Board and Tile classes. I also added the variables(fields) that we will be using to both classes, along with the accessor methods in the Tile class.
                                                                                                                                            Jionghao: I created the rest of the methods in the tile class.
                                                                                                                                            
01-04-2019:                                                                                                                                
Victoria: I worked on the constructor in Board.java, specifically on what to do during Normal Mode and the easy level.
                                                                                                                                            
01-05-2019:                                                                                                                                
Victoria: I finished working on the Normal and Crazy mode parts for the easy level in the constructor. I also added the code for the toString method that Jionghao and I worked on in class on 1/04.

Jionghao: i added the ascii art for the welcome and gameover page.
